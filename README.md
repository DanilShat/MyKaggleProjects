# MyKaggleProjects
This repository is a set of my projects on Kaggle, with their descriptions, links and code

1. [Prompt-based Job Recommendation with GRU Model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/purrrplehaze/prompt-based-job-recommendation-with-gru-model) - This code represents the implementation of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model that is trained on descriptions of various jobs. After training, the model is capable of classifying and suggesting several suitable job options based on a user-input prompt.

2. [Fake News Detection with MLPClassifier](https://www.kaggle.com/code/purrrplehaze/fake-news-detection-with-mlpclassifier) - This project aims to detect fake news. The process involves several steps: Data Exploration: Initially, the data is explored to understand its structure, features, and distributions. Text Preprocessing: The text data is preprocessed to make it suitable for modeling. This includes cleaning, normalization, and other necessary transformations. Pipeline Construction: A pipeline is constructed with a vectorizer and the MLPClassifier. The vectorizer transforms the text data into a format that can be used by the MLPClassifier. Model Evaluation: Finally, the performance of the model is evaluated to verify the results. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in the field of information verification, providing a reliable tool for fake news detection.

3. [GRU-based Text Spam Classifier](https://www.kaggle.com/code/purrrplehaze/gru-based-text-spam-classifier) - This code implements a text classification task to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The process begins with an exploratory data analysis, followed by data preprocessing. The GRU model is then trained on the preprocessed data. Finally, various metrics are calculated to evaluate the performance of the model. This GRU-based classifier provides an efficient and effective method for spam detection in text data.

4. [Thematic Analysis of reviews using LDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/purrrplehaze/thematic-analysis-of-reviews-using-lda) - In this project, I delve into a comprehensive analysis of user reviews for the GCash app. By employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, I manage to bring to light the primary issues users grapple with while using this app. In addition, I scrutinize the app's rating trends and take a close look at the most recent and popular reviews for a deeper understanding. This project is designed to equip GCash app developers with a clearer comprehension of their users' needs and stumbling blocks, thereby offering valuable data for product improvement.

5. [A Temporal Analysis of Spotify Songs](https://www.kaggle.com/code/purrrplehaze/a-temporal-analysis-of-spotify-songs) - This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of songs on Spotify over the years. It delves into the intricate patterns and trends that have shaped the music industry, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of popularity and its correlation with various factors. The code includes a series of visualizations that depict the popularity of songs based on different parameters, providing a clear picture of how these elements influence a song's success. Furthermore, it explores the correlation between these factors, revealing interesting relationships that could potentially explain shifts in musical trends. By examining these trends and correlations, this project aims to understand how music has evolved over time.

6. [Thematic Analysis of Product Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/code/purrrplehaze/thematic-analysis-of-product-reviews) - In this project, I will be conducting a thematic analysis of product reviews. My goal is to extract meaningful insights from the text data provided by the reviews. I will be using two main techniques for my analysis: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): This is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar. In the context of text data, it is used to classify text in a document to a particular topic. It builds a topic per document model and words per topic model, modeled as Dirichlet distributions. Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TruncatedSVD): This is a matrix factorization technique that, unlike PCA, works on sample matrices directly rather than their covariance matrices. When the column vectors of the sample matrix have different scales, it's often beneficial to use TruncatedSVD over PCA. By applying these techniques, I aim to uncover the underlying themes of the reviews and gain deeper understanding of the customers' opinions and preferences. This project is part of my self-learning journey and an effort to gain hands-on experience in the field of text analytics and natural language processing.

7. [Anime Similarity Search: An Experiment with GRU](https://www.kaggle.com/code/purrrplehaze/anime-similarity-search-an-experiment-with-gru) - This project is an exploration of using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to find anime similar to a user-specified title. The process involves several steps: Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and prepared for the model. Model Building: A GRU model is constructed and trained on the preprocessed data. Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed. While this GRU implementation may not be the most optimal solution for this task, it's an interesting experiment to see how well it can perform. It's worth noting that the model's performance might improve if reviews of the anime are included in the data. In such a case, this model could potentially be used as a recommendation system. Please note that this is an experimental project and the results should be interpreted accordingly.

8. [Fine-Tuning DistilBERT for Restaurant Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/code/purrrplehaze/fine-tuning-distilbert-for-restaurant-reviews) - In this project, we fine-tune the distilbert-base-uncased model for sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews. The goal is to classify whether a review indicates that the customer liked or did not like their experience. This involves training the model on a dataset of restaurant reviews and their corresponding sentiments (Liked/Not Liked), and then using the trained model to predict sentiments for new, unseen reviews.

9. [FIFA Player Rating Predictor](https://www.kaggle.com/code/purrrplehaze/fifa-player-rating-predictor) - This code represents a neural network model that predicts FIFA player ratings based on their in-game statistics. The model was built out of curiosity to understand the somewhat non-intuitive rating system of FIFA. It also identifies the top 20 players whose actual ratings deviate the most from the predicted ratings, thereby highlighting potentially unfairly evaluated players. This project provides an interesting insight into the FIFA rating system and could be a useful tool for FIFA enthusiasts.
